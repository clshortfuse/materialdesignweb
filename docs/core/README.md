# Core system (advanced)

The core system is for extending MDW with new components and behavior.
If you only need to use components, stay in the components docs.

## When to use the core

- You need custom components beyond the library
- You need custom state patterns or lifecycle behavior
- You need to compose multiple MDW components into a reusable element

## Core entry points

- [Creating custom elements](creating-custom-elements.md)
- [CustomElement API](custom-element.md)
- [Observable properties](observable-properties.md)
- [State overview](state.md)

## Reference lists

- [Core modules](modules.md)
- [Mixins](mixins.md)
